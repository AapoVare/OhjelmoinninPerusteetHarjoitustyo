Made by: Aapo VÃ¤re
Description:
    This program lets the user create a username and a password, then use them to log in.
    The program then writes the usernames and passwords into separate txt files.
    Originally this program was supposed to also be able to read the logins and passwords files so successful logins could be made with the info in them,
    but I failed to implement it correctly.
